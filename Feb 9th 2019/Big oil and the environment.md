In america, the world’s largest economy and its second biggest polluter, climate change **is becoming hard to ignore**. Extreme weather has grown more frequent. In November wildfires **scorched** California; last week Chicago was colder than parts of Mars. Scientists are **sounding the alarm more urgently** and people have noticed—73% of Americans polled by Yale University late last year said that climate change is real. The left of the Democratic Party wants to put a “Green New Deal” at the heart of the election in 2020. ***As expectations shift***, the private sector is showing signs of adapting. Last year around 20 coal mines shut. **Fund managers** are **prodding** firms to become greener. Warren Buffett, no sucker for fads, is staking $30bn on clean energy and Elon Musk plans to fill America’s highways with electric cars.

***Yet amid the clamour is a single, jarring truth.*** Demand for oil is rising and the energy industry, in America and globally, is planning multi-trillion-dollar investments to satisfy it. No firm **embodies** this strategy better than ExxonMobil, the giant that **rivals** admire and green activists love to hate. As our briefing explains, it plans to pump 25% more oil and gas in 2025 than in 2017. If the rest of the industry pursues even **modest growth**, the consequence for the climate could be disastrous.

ExxonMobil shows that the market cannot solve climate change by itself. **Muscular government action** is needed. **Contrary to the** fears of many **Republicans** (and hopes of some **Democrats**), that need not involve a **bloated** role for the state.

For much of the 20th century, the five oil majors—Chevron, ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, bp and Total—had more clout than some small countries. Although the majors’ power has waned, they still account for 10% of global oil and gas output and 16% of upstream investment. They set the tone for smaller, privately owned energy firms (which control another quarter of investment). And millions of pensioners and other savers rely on their profits. Of the 20 firms paying the biggest dividends in Europe and America, four are majors.
