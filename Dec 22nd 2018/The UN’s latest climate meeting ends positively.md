Hosting cop24, the latest of the un’s annual climate **summits**, in Katowice ***was meant to symbolise the transition from an old, dirty world to a new, clean one***. ***Spiritually***, the city is the home of Poland’s coal miners. Today, it is **replete** with besuited management consultants and bearded baristas. The venue itself was on top of a disused mine in the city centre.  

Ahead of the two-week powwow, which concluded on December 15th, many feared the meeting would ***instead*** **highlight** the **unresolved** **contradictions** **involved** in that transition. So it came as a relief when nearly 14,000 delegates from 195 countries managed—more or less, and a day late—to achieve the gathering’s main objective: a “rule book” for putting into practice the Paris agreement of 2015, which commits the world to keeping global warming “well below” 2°C relative to pre-industrial times, and **preferably** within 1.5°C.  

This outcome was far from **assured**. Setting an **abstract** goal, as governments had in Paris, is simpler than agreeing on how to go about reaching it. Technicalities—what counts as a reduction in **emissions**, who monitors countries’ progress and so on—can be **politically** **thorny**. Poland’s right-wing government, which **presided over the talks**, lacks both friends (**alienated** by, among other things, its **anti-democratic** attacks on **judicial** independence) and green **credentials**. Observers were braced for a **diplomatic debacle**.

#### Implementing the judgment of Paris  

The summit got off to an inauspicious start. At the **outset** Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, declared that his country cannot **reasonably** be expected to give up its 200 years’ worth of coal **reserves**. In France, his opposite number, Emmanuel Macron, caved in to massive **protests** and **suspended** a planned fuel-tax rise intended to help curb greenhouse-gas emissions from transport. Days earlier, Brazil had withdrawn its offer to host next year’s summit after Jair Bolsonaro, the president-elect who takes office in January and who would love to follow his American counterpart, Donald Trump, out of the Paris deal, said his government had no interest.  

Despite these early **setbacks**, **negotiators** **resolved** most of 2,800-odd points of **contention** in the rule book’s pre-summit draft. Michal Kurtyka, the **amiable** Polish **bureaucrat** who chaired the **proceedings**, turned apparent haplessness into a virtue, by leaving delegates space to thrash out their differences.

Poor countries won firmer **assurances** that rich ones would help pay for their efforts to curb their greenhouse-gas emissions and to adapt to rising sea levels and **fiercer floods**, **droughts**, storms and other climate-related problems. The rich world, for its part, **cajoled** China into accepting uniform guidelines for **tallying** those emissions. Thus stripped of their most powerful voice, other developing countries **reluctantly** followed suit. If any cannot meet the standards, they must explain why and present a plan to make amends. This concession, long demanded by the Americans, may not **persuade** Mr Trump to keep the United States in the deal. But it could make things easier for any successor who wished to re-enter it after Mr Trump has left office.
