Their words were **guarded**, their tone **sober**. At a **Politburo meeting** to discuss economic plans for 2019, China’s top leaders agreed that they should be ready for problems and ***must, above all***, maintain **domestic** stability. It was a ***striking contrast*** with the same meeting a year earlier. Then the Politburo ***oozed confidence***, concluding that China was the world’s economic engine, with a new level of power.  

This ***nervous, inward turn*** explains why, after a year of eye-for-eye fighting with America, China is determined[adj.   having made a firm decision and being resolved not to change it.] to bring the trade war to an end. The view, once commonly heard in Beijing, that it could **outlast** America in a ***grinding tariff battle*** has given way to the realisation that, as the country with the huge ***trade surplus***, China has more to lose **upfront**. Optimism that the government could fight on two fronts—taming its heavy debt burden at the same time as taking on America—has also cracked. The economic outlook has darkened. Analysts are ***debating whether*** the government will, once again, deploy a big ***fiscal stimulus*** to ***prop up growth***.  

So the swagger from a year ago is being replaced by more **conciliatory** messages. At a recent forum Ma Jiantang, vice-president of a think-tank under the cabinet, ***emphasised*** the deep ties between China’s and America’s economies. “We are **inseparable**,” he said. The immediate goal for Chinese officials is to sustain the trade truce that Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping agreed to after the recent g20 summit in Argentina. They have until March 1st to ***reach a deal***, otherwise the two countries may hit each other with tariffs again.

China’s peace offering is starting to come together. The government has made or hinted at a series of **concessions** over the past two weeks. It has **resumed** purchases of American soyabeans, announced tariff cuts on auto imports and indicated that it will modify an industrial policy that stokes suspicion abroad. This is the most notable series of steps taken by China to respond to America’s trade gripes. Whether they will satisfy Mr Trump is another matter.  

The early signs are that ***he likes what he sees on the table***. On December 14th, after the Chinese state council said it would temporarily cancel an extra 25% import tariff on American cars (imposed in retaliation for American tariffs), Mr Trump tweeted with glee. “China wants to make a big and very **comprehensive** deal. It could happen, and rather soon!”

But Chinese ***negotiators are not about to uncork fine bottles of moutai just yet***. One wild card is Meng Wanzhou, the finance chief of Huawei, a Chinese tech giant, who was detained by Canada on an extradition request from America. China has tried to **insulate** her case from the trade talks. Conveniently, it has been able to focus its ire on Cyanada, detaining two Canadian citizens in China as thinly veiled revenge. But if Canada does hand Ms Meng to America, the truce would come under **strain**. Moreover, America might pick new fights. The justice department is reportedly set to **indict** Chinese hackers over economic espionage.
