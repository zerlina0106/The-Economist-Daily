   Think of the upper **echelons** of the money-management business,   
and the image that ***springs to mind*** is of **fusty** private banks in Geneva or London’s Mayfair  *[a fashionable and opulent district in the West End of London.]*  
, with marble lobbies and fake country-house meeting-rooms designed to make their super-rich clients feel at home.  
But that picture is out of date. A more **accurate** one would feature hundreds of ***glassy private offices*** in California and   Singapore that invest in Canadian bonds, European **property** and Chinese startups—and whose **gilded patrons** are   sleepwalking into a political storm.
