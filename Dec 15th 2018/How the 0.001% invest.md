Think of the upper **echelons** of the money-management business,   
and the image that ***springs to mind*** is of **fusty** private banks in Geneva or London’s Mayfair  *[a fashionable and opulent district in the West End of London.]*  
, with marble lobbies and fake country-house meeting-rooms designed to make their super-rich clients feel at home.  
But that picture is out of date. A more **accurate** one would feature hundreds of ***glassy private offices*** in California and   Singapore that invest in Canadian bonds, European **property** and Chinese startups—and whose **gilded patrons** are   sleepwalking into a political storm.


Global finance is being transformed as billionaires get richer and cut out the **middlemen** by creating their own “family offices”, personal investment firms that **roam** global markets looking for opportunities. ***Largely unnoticed***, family offices have become a ***force*** in investing, with up to $4trn of **assets—more** than hedge funds and equivalent to 6% of the value of the world’s stockmarkets. As they grow even bigger in an era of populism, family offices are destined to face uncomfortable questions about how they concentrate power and **feed inequality**.

The concept is hardly new;*[这个概念并不新鲜]* John D. Rockefeller set up his family office in 1882. But the number has **exploded** this century. Somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 are based in America and Europe and in Asian hubs such as Singapore and Hong Kong. Though their main task is to manage financial assets, the biggest offices, some with hundreds of staff, **undertake** all sorts of other **chores**, from tax and legal work to acting as high-powered butlers who book jets and pamper pets.

The costs of bringing such expertise in-mansion means that they generally make sense only for those worth over $100m, the top 0.001% of the global pile. Asian **tycoons** such as Jack Ma of Alibaba have created their own **fiefs**. The largest Western family offices, such as the one set up by George Soros, an investor and philanthropist, oversee tens of billions and are ***as muscular as*** Wall Street firms, competing with banks and **private-equity** groups to buy whole companies.
